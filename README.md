# How to get a github token

1. To to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
2. Click `Generate new token`
3. Choose which repositories you'll use the token with
4. You need `Read and Write` permissions on `Contents`. You'll also need `Read` on `Metadata`, but that's auto-selected.
  - __Note__: if you review this token after it's created, it will say `Read and Write access to Code` for the `Content` permission.
